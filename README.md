# Ecommerce-Backend
Backend code for an e-commerce site

## Description
This project uses MySQL, Sequelize, and Express to create a backend framework for interacting with an e-commerce database. This database contains tables for products, categories, and tags. Using these tables a retail company can create, read, update, and delete items from their catalog. Each product has a name, price, and the number stocked. Products can belong to a category to help organize like-items together. In addition, products can reference various descriptive tags to increase searchability.
